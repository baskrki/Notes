\subsection{Zeros of Polynomials}

\begin{definition}
    A number $\lambda \in \mathbf{F}$ is called a \textit{zero}(or \textit{root}) of a polynomial $p \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbf{F})$ if
    \[ p(\lambda) = 0 \]
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
Suppose $m$ is a positive integer and $p \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbf{F})$ is a polynomial of degree $m$.
Suppose $\lambda \in \mathbf{F}$. Then $p(\lambda) = 0$ if and only if there exists a polynomial
$q \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbf{F})$ of degree $m-1$ such that
\[
    p(z) = (z - \lambda) q(z)
\]
for every $z \in \mathbf{F}$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    Not so hard.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
    Suppose $m$ is a positive integer and $p \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbf{F})$ is a polynomial of degree $m$. Then $p$ has at most $m$ roots in
    $\mathbf{F}$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    We'll use induction. For $m=1$, it is quite straight forward, as the polynomial $a_0 + a_1z$ only has one zero which is $-a_0/a_1$.
    Now, suppose the assumption holds for all polynomial with degree $m-1$. 
    Let $p$ be a polynomial of degree $m$, then if $p$ has no zeros then we're done. Suppose $\lambda \in \mathbb{F}$ such that
    $p(\lambda)=0$, then using our previous proposition we get
    \[ p(z)=(z-\lambda)q(z) \]
    where $q(z)$ has degree $m-1$. This shows that zeros of $p$ are exactly the zeros of $q(z)$ and $\lambda$, which is at most $m$.  
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
    The result above implies that, coefficients of a polynomial are uniquely determined
\end{remark}

\subsubsection{Division Algorithm for Polynomials}

\begin{proposition}
    Suppose that $p,s \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbf{F})$ with $s \neq 0$. Then there exists a unique polynomials $q,r \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbf{F})$
    such that 
    \[ p=sq+r \]
    and $\deg r < \deg s$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose $\deg p = n$ and $\deg s = m$. If $n < m$ then, $q=0$ and $r=p$. Thus assume that $n \ge m$. Then, take the list 
    \[ 1,z,z^2,\ldots,z^m-1,s,sz,\ldots,sz^{n-m} \]
    this list is linearly independent in $\mathcal{P}_{n}(\mathbf{F})$ as every element has a different degree. 
    Also, the length of the list is $n+1$, thus this list is a basis of $\mathcal{P}_{n}(\mathbf{F})$. But since 
    $p \in \mathcal{P}_{n}(\mathbf{F})$, we can write $p$ as 
    \begin{align*}
        p &= a_0 + a_1 z + \cdots + a_{m-1}z^{m-1} + b_0s+b_1zs + \cdots + b_{n-m}sz^{n-m} \\
        &= \underbrace{a_0 + a_1 z + \cdots + a_{m-1}z^{m-1}}_{r}+ s\underbrace{(b_0+b_1z + \cdots + b_{n-m}z^{n-m})}_{q}
    \end{align*}
    as desired.
\end{proof}

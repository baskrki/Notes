\subsection{The Isomorphism Theorems}

\begin{theorem}(First Isomorphism Theorem)
    If $\varphi : G \to H$ is a group homomorphism, then $\ker \varphi \normal G$ and $G/\ker \varphi \cong 
    \varphi(G)$. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    we have already shown the first part of the theorem, which is $\ker \varphi \normal G$.
\end{proof}

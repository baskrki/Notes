\subsection{More on Cosets and Lagrange's Theorem}

\begin{proposition}
    If $G$ is a finite subgroup and $H$ be its subgroup then order of $H$ divides order of $G$ and the number of left cosets of $H$ in $G$
    is exactly $\frac{|G|}{|H|}$.  
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    Let $|H|=n$ and let $k$ be the number of left cosets of $H$ in $G$. By definition of a left coset the map
    \[ \Psi : H \to gH \quad \text{defined by} \quad h \to gh \] 
    is a surjection from $H$ to left coset  $gH$. Also, if $\Psi(h_1)=\Psi(h_2)$ then $gh_1 = gh_2 \implies h_1=h_2$. Thus,
    the map $\Psi$ is a bijection and 
    \[ |H|=|gH| \]
    Since, $G$ is partitioned into $k$ disjoint cosets of $H$ which have the same order as $H$, we have 
    \[ |G|=nk \implies \frac{|G|}{|H|}=k \] 
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
    If $G$ is a group (possibly infinite) and $H \le G$, then the number of left cosets of $H$ in $G$ is called the \textit{index} of $H$
    in $G$ and is denoted by $|G:H|$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
    If $G$ is a finite group and $x \in G$, then order of $x$ divides the order of $G$. In particular $x^{|G|}=1$ for all $x \in G$.
\end{proposition}

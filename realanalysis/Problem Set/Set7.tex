\section{Problem Set 7}

\begin{problem}
Consider the set
\[
X := \left\{ (a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots) \;\middle|\; \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} a_j^2 \text{ converges} \right\}.
\]

Define the function $d : X \times X \to \RR$ as follows. For
\[
x = (a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots), \quad y = (b_1,b_2,b_3,\ldots) \in X,
\]
define
\[
d(x,y) := \sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^{\infty} (a_j - b_j)^2 }.
\]

\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that the function $d$ is well-defined. Equivalently, show that for
\[
x = (a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots) \quad \text{and} \quad y = (b_1,b_2,b_3,\ldots) \in X,
\]
the series
\[
\sum_{j=1}^{\infty} (a_j - b_j)^2
\]
converges.

\item Show that the function $d$ satisfies the triangle inequality. You may use the following triangle inequality in $\mathbb{R}^n$ without proof. For all $n \ge 1$,
\[
\sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^{n} (a_j - c_j)^2}
\le
\sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^{n} (a_j - b_j)^2}
+
\sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^{n} (b_j - c_j)^2}.
\]

\item Consider a sequence in $X$ defined as
\[
x_1 = (1,0,0,0,\ldots), \quad
x_2 = (0,1,0,0,\ldots), \quad \text{and so on}.
\]
In general,
\[
x_n = (0,\ldots,0,\underbrace{1}_{n\text{th position}},0,\ldots).
\]
Show that $(x_n)$ has no convergent subsequence.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\textit{Solution.}

For $(1.)$, Let $\dps S^a_N = \sum_{j=1}^{N} a_j^2$ and $\dps S^b_N = \sum_{j=1}^{N} b_j^2$. We know that $\dps \lim_{n \to \infty} S^a_n$
and $\dps \lim_{n \to \infty} S^b_n$ exists, therefore $\dps \lim_{n \to \infty} S^a_n + S^b_n$ exists. And since,

\[  0 \le (a_j - b_j)^2 = a_j^2+b_j^2- 2a_jb_j \le a_j^2+b_j^2+ 2|a_jb_j| \le 2(a_j^2+b_j^2)  \]
The last inequality is due to AM-GM inequality. Therefore,
\[ 0 \le (a_j-b_j)^2 \le 2(a_j^2+b_j^2)  \]
and we have that $\dps \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} (a_j - b_j)^2$ converges from comparison test.

\bigskip
For $(2.)$, just takes the limit as $n \to \infty$.

\bigskip

For $(3.)$, suppose there is a convergent subsequence and let $x_{n_k} \to x$
\[ d(x_{n_k},x_{n_{\ell}}) \le d(x_{n_k},x)+d(x,x_{n_{\ell}}) \]
Now, notice that for $n_k \neq n_\ell$ we have $d(x_{n_k},x_{n_\ell})=\sqrt{2}$.
Thus, for large $n_k$ and $m_{\ell}$ we have
\[ d(x_{n_k},x_{n_\ell}) \le d(x_{n_k},x)+d(x,x_{n_\ell}) < \frac{\eps}{2} + \frac{\eps}{2} \]
\[ \implies \sqrt{2} < \eps \]
But for $\eps < \sqrt{2}$ thats false.

\begin{problem}
Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space and $(x_n)$ a sequence in $X$. Denote
\[
E = \{x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots\}.
\]
Suppose $(x_n)$ has no convergent subsequence. Show that for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$, there exists $r_k > 0$ such that
\[
B(x_k, r_k) \cap E = \{x_k\}.
\]

You may use the following fact without proof. Fix $x \in X$. Suppose that for all $r > 0$, there are infinitely many elements in $E \cap B(x,r)$. Then $(x_n)$ has a subsequence which converges to $x$.

\medskip

\noindent\textbf{Remark.} You might find it easier to first show this when $(X,d) = \mathbb{R}$ and then adapt your argument to a general metric space $(X,d)$.

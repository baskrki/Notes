\begin{problem}
    Let $\FF$ be a ordered field with $1 \neq 0$. Show that $1 > 0$.
\end{problem}

\textit{Solution.}
First let us prove that $(-1)\cdot (-1)=1$. We know that for all $x \in \FF$, there is an inverse element $-x$ such that,
\[ x+(-x)=0 \]
Thus, $1+(-1)=0$ which means that 
\[ 0 = (-1) \cdot 0 = (-1) \cdot (1+(-1)) = (-1) \cdot 1 + (-1) \cdot (-1) = (-1) + (-1) \cdot (-1)   \]
\[ \implies 1 = (-1) \cdot (-1) \]

Since $\FF$ is a ordered field, one of the statement below must be true because of the \textbf{first axiom of order}.
\begin{align}
    1 < 0, \quad 1 = 0, \quad 0 < 1 
\end{align}
We assumed that $1 \neq 0$ so the middle statement can't be true and if $1 < 0$ then $0 < (-1)$. But from 
\textbf{axiom of order and multiplication} $0 < (-1)\cdot(-1) = 1$.
Thus a contradiction.

\section{Problem Set 3}

\begin{problem}
    Prove that for reals $x<y$, there exists a $r \in \QQ$ such that $x<r<y$.
\end{problem}

\textit{Solution.}
Using the archimedean property of $\RR$
\[ \exists n \in \NN, \text{ s.t } \frac{1}{n} < y-x \]
\[ \implies n(y-x)>1 \]
Since the difference is greater than $1$, there exists a integer $m$ such that
\[ nx < m < ny \Longrightarrow x < \frac{m}{n} < y  \]
Hence we are done.

\begin{problem}
    Let $E$ be an non-empty subset of $\RR$ which is bounded. Define
    \[ F := \set{x^2 \mid x \in E} \]
    Show that $\sup F$ exists and that $\sup F=\max\{(\sup E)^2,(\inf E)^2\}$.
\end{problem}

\textit{Solution.}
